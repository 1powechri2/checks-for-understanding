## Week One - Module 3 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week (which is a TON!). 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What is `json` and why is it important?
2. What's the difference between `joins` and `includes` in ActiveRecord?
3. What's an API?
4. How do we test an internal API (in general)?
